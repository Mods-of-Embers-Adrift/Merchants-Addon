# Show Profession Recipes By Level

A MelonLoader mod for **Embers Adrift**  
**Only shows recipes in merchant shops that match your current professions and crafting level!**

---

## What Does It Do?

By default, Ember's Adrift merchants may show you recipes for all professions and levelsâ€”even those you can't use or craft yet.  
This mod filters the merchant's inventory to **only display recipes matching your character's current profession (Mastery) _and_ for which you have the required crafting level**.

## How it Works

- **Without this mod:**  
  - The merchant shop lists recipes for all professions and levels, creating clutter and confusion.
- **With this mod:**  
  - The merchant shop only displays recipes that match your character's profession (Mastery).
  - Only recipes for which you meet the minimum required crafting level are shown.
  - Recipes for other professions, or those that require a higher level, are hidden.
  - All other non-recipe items from the vendor remain visible.
