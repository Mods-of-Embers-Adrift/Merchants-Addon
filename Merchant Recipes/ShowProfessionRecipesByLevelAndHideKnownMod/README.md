# Show Profession Recipes By Level and Hide Known

A MelonLoader mod for **Embers Adrift**

---

## What Does It Do?

- **Only shows recipes in merchant shops that:**
  - Match your character's profession (Mastery)
  - Are at or below your crafting level for that profession
  - Are NOT already known by your character
- Non-recipe items remain visible as usual.

---

## How it Works

- **Without this mod:**
  - The merchant shop lists recipes for all professions, all levels, and even ones you already know.
- **With this mod:**
  - The merchant shop only displays recipes that match your character's profession (Mastery).
  - Only recipes for which you meet the minimum required crafting level are shown.
  - Recipes you have already learned are hidden.
  - All other non-recipe items from the vendor remain visible.
