# HideKnownRecipesMod

## What Does It Do?

By default, Ember's Adrift merchants list **all recipes for sale**, even ones your character has already learned.  
This mod hides any recipes you already know, so you only see recipes you haven't learned yet when shopping at vendors.

---

## How it works

- **Without this mod:**  
  - The merchant UI shows every recipe for sale, including ones you've already learned.
- **With this mod:**  
  - Recipes you already know are filtered out of the merchant shop window.  
  - You'll only see recipes you haven't learned yetâ€”no more buying duplicates by accident!
